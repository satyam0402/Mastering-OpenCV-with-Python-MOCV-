# Mastering-OpenCV-with-Python-MOCV-
Hands-on projects and exercises from the Mastering OpenCV with Python course. Covers classical image/video processing, color segmentation, contour analysis, lane detection, augmented reality, deep learning integration (TensorFlow, PyTorch), object detection &amp; tracking, OCR, super resolution, and cloud deployment with Streamlit on GCP/AWS/Azure.

This repository documents my learning journey through the **Mastering OpenCV with Python** course from OpenCV University.  
It contains module-wise notebooks, scripts, and applications covering both **classical computer vision techniques** and **modern deep learning integrations**.


# Course Coverage

The course covers:

- **Core Image & Video Processing**: reading/writing, resizing, filtering, color space conversions.  
- **Basic & Advanced Operations**: arithmetic operations, histograms, color segmentation, contour detection.  
- **Applications**: watermarking, lane detection, intruder detection, image restoration.  
- **Human-Centric AI**: face detection, facial landmarks, blink detection, pose estimation, person segmentation.  
- **Deep Learning with OpenCV**: classification, object detection (SSD, YOLO v4â€“v9), text detection & OCR.  
- **Special Topics**: super resolution, barcodes & QR codes, depth-based effects.  
- **Deployment**: Streamlit web apps, GCP/AWS/Azure cloud deployment.
